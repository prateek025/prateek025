### Hi there, I am Prateek ðŸ‘‹.

I am a Data Scientist with a background in Engineering and Business. I hold a B.Tech in Electronics Engineering, a Masters in Analytics, and an MBA. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist @ CIBC, where I do statistical analysis and build machine learning models to solve different 'business puzzles'.
